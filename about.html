                    <p>I have been brewing for about 15 years starting with a few extract kits and getting into all grain after that. I am a <a href="https://www.bjcp.org" target=new class="beernav">BJCP judge</a> and have also worked in the Craft Beer business for <a href="http://offshoreale.com/beer/" target=new class="beernav">Offshore Ales</a>. My passion in brewing is mainly around Belgian and English inspired Ales.  </p><br />

                    <p>I have been keeping track of my beers over time via recipe journals but wanted to create this online journal and project of sorts to track progress/my thoughts as a brewer and a homebrewery. This visual journal will take the place of the analog journal of recipes I've been keeping. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What's up with the Binche name?</strong> Belgium and brewing in the Belgian tradition has always been a huge influence on how I approach beer and homebrewing. Belgium has a diverse range of beer "styles" and breweries from old school to new school. Belgian brewers tend to throw out the rules and focus on flavors rather than a strict historical approach..
                   <br />  <br /> 
                    Binche is a Walloon city and municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut, the origin of my favorite style of beer in the world; <strong>Saison.</strong>  So as a homage to my favorite style, I named this brewing project after the area.

                    <p>Me, my wife, our two rdogs and six chickens live on about an acre of land of which 1/4 of that is set aside for organic food production including hops and grains (a project I'm currently working on). So I guess I can finally call myself a Farmhouse Brewer in the modern sense of farming. We are on Cape Cod in Massachusetts surrounded by the Atlantic. This is where I brew and this property is a huge part of our lives. </p><br />

                    <h5 class="beertitleabout">The Setup</h5> <br />
                    <p>I brew everything from 10 gallon batches on a propane burner all the way down to 2 gallon batches on our electric stove. I brew all grain using a method called Brew In A Bag (BIAB) but I use a stainless steel basket. I ferment most of my beers in a stainless 7 gallon fermentor and keg or bottle the final product depending on carbonation levels I'm looking for.  I will be writing an acticle detailing this equiptment soon. </p><br />
