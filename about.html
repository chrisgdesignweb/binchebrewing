                    <p>I have been brewing on and off for about 15 years starting with a few extract kits and getting into all grain (and never looking back). I am a BJCP judge and have also worked in the Craft Beer business for <a href="http://offshoreale.com/beer/" target=new class="beernav">Offshore Ales</a>. At one time I had a dream of going pro, but now am just super stoked brewing my own beers and sharing with  friends. My passion in brewing is mainly in the Belgian tradition, which I talk about further down the page. I brew alot of session strength ales in the 3-5% range but will also go as high as 10% ABV on a special occassions. </p><br />

                    <p>I have been keeping track of my beers over time via recipe journals but wanted to create this online journal and project of sorts to track progress/my thoughts as a brewer and a homebrewery. This visual journal will hopefully take place of the analog journal of recipes I've been keeping. </p>
                   <p>What's up with the Binche name?  Well Belgium and brewing in the Belgian tradition has always been a huge influence on how I approach beer and homebrewing. Belgium has a diverse range of beer "styles" and breweries from old school to new school. Belgian brewers tend to throw out the rules and focus on flavors rather than a strict historical approach. 
                    <br />  <br /> 
                    Binche is a Walloon city and municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut, the origin of my favorite style of beer in the world; <strong>Saison.</strong>  So as a homage to my favorite style, I named my project after the area.

                    <h5 class="beertitleabout">The Farmhouse</h5> <br />
                    <p>Me, my wife, our two dogs and six chickens live on about an acre of land of which 1/4 of that is set aside for organic food production including hops and grains (a project I'm working on). So I guess I can finally call myself a Farmhouse Brewer in the modern sense of farming. We are on Cape Cod in Massachusetts surrounded by the Atlantic. This is where I brew and this property is a huge part of our lives. We refer to it as our little homestead. </p><br />

                    <h5 class="beertitleabout">The Setup</h5> <br />
                    <p>I brew everything from 10 gallon batches on a propane burner all the way down to 2 gallon batches on our electric stove. I brew all grain using a method called Brew In A Bag (BIAB) but I use a stainless steel basket. I ferment most of my beers in a stainless 7 gallon fermentor and keg or bottle the final product depending on carbonation levels I'm looking for.  I will be writing an acticle detailing this equiptment soon. </p><br />
